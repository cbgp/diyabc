\section{Preface}
\subsection{General context and history of DIYABC}
In less than 10 years, Approximate Bayesian Computations (ABC) have developed in the Population Genetics community as a new tool for inference on the past history of populations and species. Compared to other approaches based on the computation of the likelihood which are still restrained to a very narrow range of evolutionary scenarios and mutation models, the ABC approach has demonstrated its ability to stick to biological situations that are much more complex and hence realistic. However, this approach still requires numerous computations to be performed so that it has been used mostly by specialists (i.e. statisticians and programmers). This has almost certainly restrained the possible impact of ABC in population genetic studies. We believe that this situation must be improved and therefore we have developed a computer program for the large community of experimental biologists. We therefore designed DIYABC as a user-friendly program allowing non specialist biologists to achieve their own analysis.\

\textbf{The first version (DIYABC v$0.x$)} had been written especially for microsatellite data. There were at least two reasons for that. The first one is that we have been among the first to develop and use this class of markers in population genetic studies \citep[e.g.][]{E1993}. Since then, we have developed microsatellites in numerous species as well as we have published theoretical studies and reviews on these markers \citep[e.g.][]{E2002}. The second reason is that microsatellites have been and still are very popular markers in the population geneticist community and there is now a large quantity of data that might benefit of an ABC approach.\

\textbf{The second version of our software (DIYABC v$1.x$)} has been designed to make use of DNA sequence data. This has several immediate consequences. For instance, the standard Genepop data file format has been extended to incorporate sequence data. This has been done in collaboration with the authors of $Genepop$ and explained in  subsection 4.1.1. In this version, sequence loci are considered in the same way as microsatellite loci, i.e. they are considered as genetically independent and intra-locus recombination is not (yet) available. Regarding mutation models for DNA sequences, we used the same philosophy as for microsatellites, i.e. the program considers only simple and widely used models, keeping in mind that a higher-dimensional parameter space will be less well explored than a lower-dimensional space. Note that none of these mutation models includes insertion-deletions. 
Also five categories of loci (either microsatellites or DNA sequences) were considered in this second version : autosomal diploid, autosomal haploid, X-linked, Y-linked and mitochondrial. Note that X-linked loci can be used for an haplo-diploid species in which both sexes have been sampled. If non-autosomal loci have been typed in population samples, the sex-ratio of the species will have to be provided (see subsection 4.1.1).\\ 

%Also for DNA sequence loci, one can choose among two possibilities : either each locus has its own mutation model or they all share the same mutation model (but not the same mutation parameters). Going back to microsatellites, there is an additional mutation parameter added to this version : the mean rate of single nucleotide insertion-deletion mutations.\\

%Given that mitochondrial DNA sequences are commonly used by population geneticists and that different effective population sizes correspond to such monoparental loci, a specific code has also been added to the genepop format to comply with this new requirement (see 4.1.1 for details). 

Other improvements over version 0 included :
\begin{enumerate}
\item the use of multithread technology in order to exploit multicore/multiprocessor computers. This is especially useful when building the reference table and for several other intensive computation steps, such as the multinomial logistic regression,
\item a new option which helps the detection of "bad" prior modelisation of the data, 
\item another new option which helps evaluate the goodness of fit of a given model-parameter posterior combination (i.e. Model checking),   
\item many new screens implemented not only to treat sequence data, but also to cope with the new options described above, as well as to offer useful complementary information on the current run. 

\end{enumerate}

 \textbf{The third version of DIYABC (DIYABC v$2.x$)}  has been entirely recoded in order to be used under the usual three OS (Linux, Windows and Mac). Also the code for computations has been separated from that of the graphic user interface (GUI). The former has been rewritten in C++ and the latter is a mixture of Python and Qt (PyQt). The user can then launch computations with or without using the GUI. The GUI 's uses are : 

\begin{enumerate}
\item the management of projects
\item the input of the historical and genetical models
\item the parameterization of analyses
\item the launch of computations  of the reference table and of the various required analyses
\item the visualization of results
\end{enumerate}

We recommend non-expert users to use the GUI for their computations.\\

Also, as DNA sequences have been added in the second version, a new category of markers has been added to the third version : Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs). Instead of extending once more the Genepop format, a new data simple format has been designed for these markers. Note that SNP data are treated separately from other markers ($i.e.$ they cannot be analyzed together with microsatellite and/or DNA sequence data). It is worth noting that, in the present version of the program, the analysed SNP data are assumed to correspond to independent selectively-neutral loci, without any ascertainment bias (i.e. the deviations from expected theoretical results due to the SNP discovery process in which a small number of individuals from selected populations are used as discovery panel). \\  

This version includes all improvements of version 1.x and a few new improvements such as :
\begin{itemize}
\item loci of the same type (i.e. microsatellites on one hand or DNA sequences on the other hand) can be associated in one or more groups. This allows for instance to define different mutation models for microsatellites with motifs of different lengths.
\item  the model checking option is now presented as a direct option (not a suboption of the ABC estimation of parameters) which largely simplifies its use.
\item the logistic regression can be performed on linear discriminant analysis components instead of all summary statistics. This reduces the number of dependent variables, thus allowing to run large "confidence in scenario choice" analyses including many summary statistics and scenarios \citep{EL2012}. 

%\item ascertainment bias in the design of SNPs can be tentatively corrected by considering ``reference'' samples in which the loci need to be polymorphic in order to belong to the SNP set. These reference samples are not necessarily included of the actual samples.
\end{itemize}

Finally, as for DIYABC V1, the present version of DIYABC V2 deals with sexually reproducing diploid or haploid species (autosomal, X-linked, Y-linked loci) but does not allow considering species reproducing clonally.

You can get there executable files for different operating systems as well as the last version of this detailed notice document.



\subsection{System requirements}
\begin{itemize}
\item DIYABC should run on any linux flavour, Microsoft Windows XP and Seven and OS x 10.5 (intel) or later.
\item Minimum 4GB of RAM; 6GB of RAM recommended 
\item 70MB free disk space for DIYABC binaries
\item From 1 to 10GB free disk space for each project depending on the project configuration and the records number in the reftable file.
\end{itemize}

Caveat : it is possible that on windows 32bits (and sometimes on windows 64bits) the reference table file will not grow more than 4Go. We hope to be able to circumvent this constraint soon on windows 64bits.

\subsection{How to create (and send) a bug report}
DIYABC V2 provides an easy way to send to the program developers the different files and clues that are necessary to attempt solving a bug. Click on the “Help” menu. Then go on the “Create bug report” tab. You then just need to following the few instructions we give you at this stage, validate and save the created bug report tarred file somewhere on your computer. Please send the bug report file to the indicated email address (\texttt{(diyabc@cbgp.supagro.fr)}). Two remarks here: (i) the bug you describe has to be the last things that you did with the program; and (ii) please try to reproduce your bug one time and then create and send the bug report. Finally, it had to be noted that if the bug completely crash the application then no bug report can be created. We will do our best to solve your bug thanks to the bug report you provided us.
