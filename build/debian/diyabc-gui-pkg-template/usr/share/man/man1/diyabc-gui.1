.SH NAME
diyabc - a user-friendly approach to Approximate Bayesian Computation.


.SH SYNOPSIS
.B diyabc-gui
[\-\-version] [\-cmd]
[\fIproject_folder_to_open\fP] ...


.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
diyabc-gui is a graphical user interface to diyabc.
.PP
DIYABC is a computer program with a graphical user interface and a fully
clickable environment. It allows population biologists to make inference based
on Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC), in which scenarios can be customized
by the user to fit many complex situations involving any number of populations
and samples. Such scenarios involve any combination of population divergences,
admixtures and population size changes.
.PP
DIYABC can be used to compare competing
scenarios, estimate parameters for one or more scenarios, and compute bias and
precision measures for a given scenario and known values of parameters 
.PP
DIYABC can be used with a headless binary called \fIdiyabc\fP. This binary
is a console-only version and behaves as if it was called by diyabc\-gui


.SH OPTIONS
diyabc\-gui accepts the following options:
.TP 8
.B \-\-version
Output version information and exit. 
.TP 8
.B \-cmd
Launch the graphical interface but also a thread dedicated to user input in the
terminal. This command line interface is actually a python console which makes
the interface objects accessible. The main object is the QMainWindow of the gui
accessible with "self.obj". All python instruction has to start with the word
"do". For example : "do print self.obj" should display "<__main__.Diyabc object
at 0x3e01170>"


.SH FILES
diyabc-gui's data files are stored in /usr/share/icons/diyabc-gui,
/usr/share/images/diyabc-gui .

diyabc-gui configuration is read in from the user's configuration file,
\fB$HOME\fP/.diyabc/config.cfg - configuration of the interface. everything that
is configurable in the file->settings screen of the interface. This file is
created on the first run of the interface.

\fB$HOME\fP/.diyabc/recent - holds a list of the last opened projects to allow a
quick access in the menu.

\fB$HOME\fP/.diyabc/logs/* - all log files are stored in this directory. Each
execution of the gui creates a log file. Their name gives execution date
indication.


.SH SUGGESTIONS AND BUG REPORTS
Any bugs found should be reported to the development team at
diyabc@supagro.inra.fr .

When reporting DIYABC bugs, it is important to include a reliable way to
reproduce the bug, version number of diyabc and diyabc-gui, OS name
and version, and any relevant hardware specs. If a bug is causing a
crash, it is very useful if a stack trace can be provided. And of
course, patches to rectify the bug are even better.


.SH OTHER INFO
The place to find DIYABC info is at www1.montpellier.inra.fr/CBGP/diyabc/ .
Here you can find tutorials, data sets, mailing list archives, and more.

There is also a DIYABC User Manual available in the diyabc-doc package.
that goes into much more detail about the interactive use of DIYABC.
