.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
diyabc is the computation executable of DIYABC.
.PP
DIYABC is a computer program with a graphical user interface and a fully
clickable environment. It allows population biologists to make inference based
on Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC), in which scenarios can be customized
by the user to fit many complex situations involving any number of populations
and samples. Such scenarios involve any combination of population divergences,
admixtures and population size changes.
.PP
DIYABC can be used to compare competing
scenarios, estimate parameters for one or more scenarios, and compute bias and
precision measures for a given scenario and known values of parameters

.SH SUGGESTIONS AND BUG REPORTS
Any bugs found should be reported to the development team at
diyabc@supagro.inra.fr .

When reporting DIYABC bugs, it is important to include a reliable way to
reproduce the bug, version number of diyabc and diyabc-gui, OS name
and version, and any relevant hardware specs. If a bug is causing a
crash, it is very useful if a stack trace can be provided. And of
course, patches to rectify the bug are even better.

Here you can find tutorials, data sets, mailing list archives, and more.

There is also a DIYABC User Manual available in the diyabc-doc package.
that goes into much more detail about the interactive use of DIYABC.
