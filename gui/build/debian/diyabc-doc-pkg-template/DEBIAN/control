 DIYABC is a computer program with a graphical user interface and a fully
 clickable environment. It allows population biologists to make inference based
 on Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC), in which scenarios can be customized
 by the user to fit many complex situations involving any number of populations
 and samples. Such scenarios involve any combination of population divergences,
 admixtures and population size changes.
 .
 DIYABC can be used to compare competing
 scenarios, estimate parameters for one or more scenarios, and compute bias and
 precision measures for a given scenario and known values of parameters
