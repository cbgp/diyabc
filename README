DIYABC V2.0

COMPILE SOURCES =========== 

DIYABC dependencies :
   - Graphical User Interface : pyqt4, matplotlib
   - DIYABC core : gcc (with open-mp)
   - Documentation : latex

How to compile :
   tar -xzf diyabc-v2.xx-source.tgz
   cd diyabc-v2.xx
   make clean
   MYFLAGS="-static" make

DIYABC binary, named "general", should be in the src-JMC-C++ directory. 

For HPC cluster, you must compile DIYABC on your cluster and set the binary in DIYABC 
interface preferences>>cluster panel :
 - First choose "cluster" in  preferences>>cluster panel and can give the full path of 
   the "general" binary file on your cluster. 
or
 - Upload the "general" file onto your own personal computer. Choose "local" in  
   preferences>>cluster panel and browse your own personal computer to find the "general" 
   binary file uploaded (the one you just compiled on your cluster).


RUN ===============

First, you must compile DIYABC sources to in order to obtain the "general" binary.
Next, Use the following commands:

   cd diyabc-v2.xx 
   bash diyabc.sh
or 
   cd diyabc-v2.xx/gui/src
   python gui/src/diyabc 

Finally, uncheck "use default executable check" and browse "Path to executable file" in the
preferences>>various panel. This will set the "general" binary file you just compile on 
your personal computer.
