Description: A user-friendly approach to Approximate Bayesian Computation for inference on population history using molecular markers. DIYABC is a computer program with a graphical user interface and a fully click-able environment. It allows population biologists to make inference based on Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC), in which scenarios can be customized by the user to fit many complex situations involving any number of populations and samples. Such scenarios involve any combination of population divergences, admixtures and population size changes. DIYABC can be used to compare competing scenarios, estimate parameters for one or more scenarios, and compute bias and precision measures for a given scenario and known values of parameters
